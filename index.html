<a name="what-is-this-" class="anchor" href="#what-is-this-"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is this ?</h2>

<p>This repo contains solutions for coding challenges on <a href="http://hackergym.com">http://hackergym.com</a>. </p>

<p>For each question, there are multiple solutions available in Java. In addition, all solutions come with extensive unit tests that test for correctness and common pitfalls and edge cases. </p>

<p>More importantly, each solution contains placeholders for you own custom solution. You can add your own solutions to these placeholders and all the unit tests will automatically run on it and verify it's correctness. </p>

<h2>
<a name="how-to-use-this-" class="anchor" href="#how-to-use-this-"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to use this ?</h2>

<p>The best way to use this repo is along with <a href="http://hackergym.com">http://hackergym.com</a>. </p>

<p>We recommend that you go through each question using the simulated environment on the website. Then, if you have a better solution and want to verify it use this repo to run our unit tests against it. </p>

<h2>
<a name="how-to-set-up" class="anchor" href="#how-to-set-up"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to set up</h2>

<p>First you need to install JDK 8 from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">here</a>. </p>

<p>After the installation do the following to make sure you have the correct version: </p>

<pre><code>$ javac -version
</code></pre>

<p>Now download the zip/tar file from top of this page and unzip it. Then follow the instructions below for your favorite java development tool. </p>

<h3>
<a name="command-line" class="anchor" href="#command-line"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Command Line</h3>

<p>From the extracted folder: </p>

<pre><code>$ cd JavaSolutions/
$ ./gradlew
$ ./gradlew test

</code></pre>

<p>This will run all the unit tests against the code. </p>

<p>You can use the <code>./gradlew</code> to run any task inlcuding build and test.</p>

<h3>
<a name="eclipse" class="anchor" href="#eclipse"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Eclipse</h3>

<p>First install Gradle from Eclipse Marketplace: <code>Help -&gt; Eclipse MarketPlace</code> : </p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hackergym-images/0.gif" alt="image">:</p>

<p>Now set you project java version to 1.8: <code>Project -&gt; Properties</code> : </p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hackergym-images/1.gif" alt="image"></p>

<p>Having installed the Gradle plugin, import the project as a Gradle project: <code>File -&gt; Import</code></p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hackergym-images/2.gif" alt="image"></p>

<p>Finally, open the Gradle Task view and run with test: <code>Window -&gt; Show View -&gt; Other</code> </p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hackergym-images/3.gif" alt="image"></p>

<p>This will run all of the unit tests on the solutions. </p>

<h3>
<a name="intellijidea" class="anchor" href="#intellijidea"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>IntellijIDEA</h3>

<p>First install The Gradle Plugin:<code>IntelliJ IDEA -&gt; Preferences -&gt; plugins</code></p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hackergym-images/I1.gif" alt="image"></p>

<p>Now import the project: <code>File -&gt; Import Project</code> 
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hackergym-images/I2.gif" alt="image"></p>

<p>Now set you JDK to 1.8: <code>File -&gt; Project Structure</code>
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hackergym-images/I3.gif" alt="image"></p>

<p>Make sure that <code>Project Language level</code> is set to 8.0 and also that your `<code>Project SDK</code> is pointing to your JDK 8 installation. </p>

<p>Finally, Run the Gradle Task window and run the test task: <code>view -&gt; Tool Windows -&gt; Gradle</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hackergym-images/I4.gif" alt="image"></p>

<h2>
<a name="project-structure" class="anchor" href="#project-structure"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Structure</h2>

<p>Under the <code>src</code> folder there are two standard folders: </p>

<ul>
<li>  <code>src/main/java</code> : Contains the actual code for solutions. Each topic has its own package and the name of the classes correspond with the name of the questions on <a href="http://hackergym.com">http://hackergym.com</a>
</li>
<li>  <code>src/test/java</code> : Contains the unit tests for solutions. The name of the packages and classes correspond with the packages and classess under <code>src/main/java</code>
</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="how-to-add-your-custom-solutions" class="anchor" href="#how-to-add-your-custom-solutions"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to Add your Custom Solutions</h2>

<p>If you go under each problem, you will see a section describing the problem and a method as soon as the class begins. The method usually has a big comment block saying "Your Custom Solution". All you need to do is to remove the existing line of code in that method and write your own solution there.  </p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hackergym-images/CustomSolution.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>Once you are done, you can run the unit tests against your solution using one of the approaches explained above. </p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hackergym-images/UnitTests.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>Unit tests will be run against your custom solution. These unit tests contain the word Custom in them so that they are easy to spot. </p>
